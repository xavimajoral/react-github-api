## Advanon Frontend Assessment

Single Page application (SPA) which displays a list of Github users by using Github public API with an option to display detailed user data on a separate page.

## Notes
* I've choosen Mocha as a test runner, Chai as assertion library and Enzyme to traverse the react components
* As you'll see I've written two simple test cases in the folder 'src/test'
    - Header.spec.js for Header Component
    - Reducer_User.spec.js for the users reducer.
* Bonus point: Loading Spinner before users have been fetched.

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the application:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Running the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```
